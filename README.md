# Thesis Simulation Code

This repository contains the full implementation of the algorithms and experiments used in the accompanying thesis. The project is structured as follows:

## Folders

### `algorithms/`
Contains the implementations of all algorithms used in the simulations.

### `tests/`
Includes basic test cases to verify the correctness of the implemented algorithms.

### `simulations/`
Scripts for running the simulation experiments referenced in the thesis:

- `compare_fleury_hierholzer.py` — Generates **Figure 6**
- `compare_mixed1_mixed2.py` — Generates **Figure 7**
- `extreme_cases_mixed1_mixed2.py` — Generates **Figure 8**
- `compare_mixed1_BnB.py` — Generates **Figure 9**
- `compare_Win_BnB.py` — Generates **Figure 10**
- `compare_BnB_algorithms.py` — Generates **Figure 11**
